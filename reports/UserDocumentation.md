# User Documentation

## Abstract

SwipeFight is an application that helps martial artists connect with local sparring partners in a fun and competitive way. Inspired by Tinderâ€™s intuitive swipe interface, users swipe right if they think they can beat an opponent and left if not. If two users swipe right on each other, they match and can coordinate a sparring session. The app includes a martial arts specific matching system, a skill-based rating system, and filters by location (WIP) and discipline. By blending gamification with community, SwipeFight offers a fresh way to build connections and sharpen fighting skills.

## Install

[How to install the software. If your system has prerequisites (e.g., tools, libraries, emulators, third-party applications, etc.), your instructions should list all of them and indicate how to install and configure them. Make sure to indicate what specific version requirements these prerequisites must satisfy. If running the system requires the installation of, e.g., a virtual machine, a database, or an emulator, make sure to provide clear step-by-step instructions.]: #

On the top of the page, there is a scrollable list of filters that filter through the possible fighters that you can see. Multiple filters may be pressed at once and it will combine the filters together (Pressing Aikido and BJJ filters will only show fighters that practice Aikido __OR__ BJJ). Pressing the 'All' filter will reset all of the filters and show all possible fighters.
