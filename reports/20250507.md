 #### Weekly Status Report 7 May 2025

# Team Report

## Goals from Last Week
 - Continue adding features to chat
 - Begin setting up database
 - Design and begin implementing profile editor page and settings page

## Progress and Issues

### Progress
 - Database is setup with user authentication
 - Profile Editor page complete
 - Merged live-chat and log in branches

### Issues
 - Profile editor contains everything we would have wanted in settings.
   - Possibly look to remove the settings button.
 - Database is only integrated with authentication not working with profile creation, profile editor, messages yet
 - The fight finder stack can be filtered by discipline but contains no other sorting algorithms yet (rating, location, etc).
 - Ensure swiper scales with screen size
 - Expo Go updated so we can not use physical mobile devices to test until we figure out how to update it (simulator works)

## Plans and Goals for Next Week
 - Have MVP ready
 - Begin integrating backend server with rest of app
 - Populate server with users (possibly via presentation)
 - Begin making concrete algorithm for matching
 - Matching (connecting users with chat)

## Agenda for Team Meeting
 - State of app
 - What to finish before beta release
